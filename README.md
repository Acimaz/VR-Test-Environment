** Scene to use for quick hand asset testing **

To make it quick and easy you should use this scene.

Also, if you import your hand assets into the project, i recommend using the "VR Test Environment/Models/Custom Models" folder" just to have everything structured nicely.

** Important objects in the scene hierarchy **

The both OVR objects are the original left and right hands used in the scene.
The "Scene Setup" object contains a script to make it easy for you to quickly import your hand assets and use it right away, without manually adding needed scripts and setting up the handsmanager.

** Test Scene Setup **

This component is pretty easy to use. Just drag & drop your hand asset from within the project into the appropriate reference slow and push the "Setup Hands" button.
The hand will be created and setup for you automatically and you could instantly build and test the hand asset.

If you want to setup another hand, you first have to delete the current one, either you search the hand object and delete it by hand or you can use the handy "Remove Hands & Setup Handsmanager" button, which will configure the scene to use the default hands.

You can also toggle the original hands on and off with the "Toggle Original Hands" button.
